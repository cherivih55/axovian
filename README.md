# Axovian

Axovian is a digital neuroscience platform designed to quantify individual brain stability, deviation, and resilience using longitudinal cognitive baseline modeling.

The platform collects daily cognitive microtask data and stressor inputs to model within-person baseline dynamics and detect deviations and recovery patterns over time.
